This is a total fucking mess.

##Files
- 1_HerokuServer - this will live online somewhere where all players/clients can log into it
- 2_Client - This is the front and back end for the client. It's build for desktop right now but I want to make it a phonegap app eventually
- 4_Clinet_phoneGap - This is just a template for phonegap for iOS


##GOAL:

Have my server with all the game mechanics on it, then have the client's front end talking to the client's local back end server, which then queries the Heroku server.

Websocks are neccessary for constant pinging
